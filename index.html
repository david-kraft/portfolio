                                        I am passionate about serving the communities I identify with. These include the local Native American and Ojibwe communities,
                                        the disabled and autistic community, as well as the communities where I have lived,
                                        worked, served, or volunteered in.

                                        In my 30+ years of life, I make connections&mdash;In person, in writing, and on the web. I use these connections both to
                                        teach and learn from the same people, whether they are students, clients, employers,
                                        colleagues, friends, family or anyone else. I desire a job where I can honestly tell
                                        the world that I live to work, as opposed to a job where I just work to live, though
                                        I also need to make enough to live if I am to sustain my place in your workplace

                                        I am in the final weeks of a full-stack web development boot camp, where I am learning to code websites myself instead of
                                        using Wordpress, Drupal, or Wix to put one together. Technologies I feel confident
                                        using are HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, ES6, JSX, MySQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku,
                                        making API calls, and jQuery. I also have been exposed to React.js, Moment.js, MongoDB,
                                        Mongoose, and Sequelize.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Initially, I was taking this course because I thought my place in life was to be a web developer, because I felt I was better
                                        with computers than I am with people. Since then, I have learned nothing could be
                                        further from the truth. I would collapse without human interaction. Even if it means
                                        making five figures instead of six for the rest of my life, I need to be happy and
                                        my jobs need to be sustainable and feel like home to me.

                                        I have always volunteered doing something, whether it be working with kids at a hospital or tutoring immigrants at the library.
                                        It seemed natural for me to serve my community through AmeriCorps. I am a member
                                        of an Ojibwe tribe in Wisconsin, but I really didn't know very much about my Native
                                        heritage.
                                    </p>

                                        MIGIZI, which is the Ojibwe term for Bald Eagle and I had a symbiotic relationship while I worked there. I gave them my technological
                                        expertise, my time, and my teaching skills, and they both taught me as much as they
                                        teach the youth they teach and they connected me with elders. Now I am participating
                                        in religious ceremonies and investing permanently as part of their community.

                                        The Minnesota Council of Nonprofits was the sponsoring organization of my VISTA project. They brought me to their conferences
                                        on fundraising, communication, leadership, and finances. Overall, I was eager to
                                        repeat the experience once my first year was ended.

                                            Despite it being a single department, Communication Studies at the UofM is actually comprised of three very different fields:
                                            Interpersonal Communication, Rhetorical Studies, and Media Studies. Honestly,
                                            I never had much interest in studying media. While I was also highly intrigued
                                            by rhetorical studies and the mechanics of persuasive speech, interpersonal communication
                                            was my major focus. That is because I am autistic and wanted to find ways to
                                            grow more effective and increase my competency as a listener and communicator
                                            both for personal and professional reasons.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One of my greatest strengths and challenges is that it is hard for me to accept that I am limited and constrained by the
                                            boundaries from my autistic identity. Whenever I find my efforts are insufficient,
                                            I learn and grow smarter and more capable so the next time I face a challenge,
                                            I succeed. Fun fact: I took Latin as my second language. I studied Cicero and
                                            Caesar's prose as well as Vergil's poetry. I also challenged myself with as many
                                            graduate level courses as I could. Sometimes I ended up dropping when I took
                                            on too much, but many classes, like Advanced Theories in Interpersonal Communication,
                                            Conflict and Communication, and Major Rhetorical Theories of the 20th Century,
                                            in which I was the only undergraduate student. I also participated in a faculty
                                            member's research project and conducted my own independent study for which I
                                            earned an A.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One of the things I miss most about the University of Minnesota was the library system. My ability to research anything that
                                            interested me was beyond compare. When I was there I learned not only advanced
                                            search methods and how to find relevant information in scholarly articles, I
                                            also learned how to use citation managers like Zotero and RefWorks to save my
                                            sources in a database in my browser or in the cloud and automatically generate
                                            bibliographies in Word. Most students I've worked with know about EasyBib and
                                            other basic tools and I show them Zotero and how it rocked my own world and they
                                            have all been impressed.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I also worked for a short time in the libraries at the University of Minnesota Archives where I retrieved materials and digitized
                                            records for the University and their customers.
